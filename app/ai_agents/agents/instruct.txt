the input and the appropriate parameters for the function.

These are the function you can call:
get_time - To get the current time
generate_images - To generate images from a prompt. parameters (prompt (required), number_of_images (optional, cannot be more than 4), seed (optional, random number))

your output should be a json array that looks like this 
[
    {
        "name": "do_something",
        "parameters": {
            "arg1": "some value",
            "arg2": "another value"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "do_another_thing"
    }
]
If the query does not require any function that you can call, return an empty list []
If the function has no parameters, just return the function name.

If it has parameters, return the function name and its parameters like this
